## Docker
Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime. Using Docker, you can quickly deploy and scale applications into any environment and know your code will run.

<h2>Virtual Machine </h2>
A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual environment that works like a computer within a computer. It runs on an isolated partition of its host computer with its own CPU power, memory, operating system (such as Windows, Linux, macOS), and other resources. End users can run applications on VMs and use them as they normally would on their workstation.

<h2>How do virtual machines work?
</h2>
Virtual machines are made possible through virtualization technology. Virtualization uses software to simulate virtual hardware that allows multiple VMs to run on a single machine. The physical machine is known as the host while the VMs running on it are called guests.

This process is managed by software known as a hypervisor. The hypervisor is responsible for managing and provisioning resources—like memory and storage—from the host to guests. It also schedules operations in VMs so they don’t overrun each other when using resources. VMs only work if there is a hypervisor to virtualize and distribute host resources.
